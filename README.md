# MD Site
This project uses a collection of scripts to generate a static site from a directory of markdown files.


## Documentation
The documentation is included as the demo site which you can serve locally with the following:
```shell
npm install
npm run build
npm run serve # Locally serve the build directory
```

You can also just [view the markdown here](content/index.md)
